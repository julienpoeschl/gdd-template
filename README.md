# Inspiration
The Game Design Document (GDD) template is inspired by the [Detailed Game Design Documentation Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17-51Uwxqle3DZVleir6OhDlWA_aerw5g/view) presented by Michael Sellers in his Game Design curriculum at Indiana University and the [Shooter: Majestic Revelations](https://archive.org/details/DeusExDesignDoc11081997/mode/2up) GDD which was later used for the game [Deus Ex](https://deusex.fandom.com/wiki/Shooter:_Majestic_Revelations#External_links).
